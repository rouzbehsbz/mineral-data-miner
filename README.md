The final project of bachelor's degree for Amirkabir University of Technology

This program is designed to extract mineral data related to countries from the
most important and reliable mineral website in the world, USGS.

The goal of the project is to simplify the process of obtaining this information,
which was previously done manually.

- Note that the information on this website is all from the USGS website and if the information
  on the mentioned website is updated, the information on this website will also be updated.
  For this reason, the information may not be available for some years for some minerals or
  countries and will be updated in the future.
